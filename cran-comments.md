## Test environments
* ubuntu 14.04, R 3.5.1
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs, WARNINGs or NOTEs

## Downstream dependencies
This update was build with backwards compatibility in mind and no downstream dependencies found using `devtools::revdep()`, so I think everything is okay.
